# Discord-Welcome-Chat-Spammer

Demo - against tos so definetly don't use it :|

This software - upon having the 3 variables of token,server and server id filled in, will constantly join and leave.
With bots like mee6,invite manager or even just the default discord welcome message, this is bound to fill up the welcome channel and make a mess.
